## How do Pre-treatments Influence Side-Channel Attacks?
ABSTRACT: The effectiveness of side-channel attacks has been a critical topic in cybersecurity since their emergence in the late 1990s. SCAs exploit physical measurements like power consumption to extract cryptographic keys, and while many studies have focused on direct attack methodologies, the impact of preprocessing techniques on the efficiency of SCAs remains underexplored. This research investigates the influence of various preprocessing methods on the success rates of Correlation Power Analysis and Linear Regression Analysis attacks. By analyzing simulated power traces from both software and hardware implementations of the AES algorithm, we evaluate preprocessing methods including raw, squared, absolute value, centered, and standardized traces. Our findings reveal that our current preprocessing methods
donâ€™t significantly improve attack effectiveness. As the number of traces increases, the impact of preprocessing diminishes even more, with all methods converging towards accurate key identification. This study highlights the potential of preprocessing to refine SCA strategies and suggests future integration of deep learning techniques to further enhance preprocessing and attack methodologies.
